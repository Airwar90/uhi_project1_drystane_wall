# uhi_project1_drystane_wall
brief:
Create an application to calculate tonnage of stone needed (and cost) to build a dry stone wall.
You will need to research and give evidence for the sources for your calculations (easy to google)
User will supply a value for square meters of wall (length and height). E.g. I want 20 meters of wall at 750mm height.
Application will return:
- a value for tonnage of stone required
- a value for cost of stone (an average or a range, cite sources)
- a value for cost of labour (an average or a range, cite sources)
You can use any technology you like to build this. A simple Python program using the shell as a UI would be fine. A Scratch project would be fine. A MERN app would be fine. An app interfacing with an AI which anticipates and corrects the mistakes made by the AI would be fine. A speech synthesis app that reads you the answers would be fine.
The key thing to do is use this as an opportunity to pull your existing skills together and stretch out a bit. So if you are an experienced developer, we want to see something that evidences that experience. If you've never written any code before, this is a good achievable goal that is the kind of program you'd be writing on page 8 or 9 of a typical Python textbook.
Extensions can include things like returning a preformatted quote for a client, returning an excel file with a breakdown of the figures, a feature for different types of stone, or for different contingencies and challenges (wet/boggy ground, scaffolding or similar support needed etc).
We will review all the work on Monday of week 2.
Be able to demo the app.
FAQs:
- Do I need to do a Jira/Kanban board? Yes
- Do I have to do this? You don't have to do anything, but why are you here?
- Can I make something else? Get used to clients telling you what to do. So, no.
- Does it matter what language I used? No. This could be a good project to start learning a new language with (if that's what you want to do).
